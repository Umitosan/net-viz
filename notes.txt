Goals
  visualize a single net's cells
  (later) visualize a net population
  1. each cell should be easily identified by its index number
  2. each cell's links with other cells should be identified by directional arrows
    2a. possibly with one color for an exitatory relationship and another color for an inhibitory relationship.
    2b. It would also be nice if the width or color intensity or some other visual property of the arrow in the relationship could be modified based on the strength of <broadcastCoeff> * <linkCoeff>.
  3. Each link between cells is uni-directional corresponding to the signal from sending cell to receiving cell.
    3a. when 2 cells both send signal to each other, show this with 2 separate arrows going back and forth, each with separate modifiers
  4. The cells which receive external input are the first n cells in the net's array where n is <inputCellsPerNet> and the cells which send external output are the next n cells in the array immediately following the input cell group where n is <outputCellsPerNet>.
    4a. All remaining cells in the array are simply involved in receiving and sending internal stimulus, but receive and send no external input or output
    4b. these three distinct groups of cells should be identified through color, border, or other differences




<netPopulation>
  group of nets who will compete against one another through evolutionary cycles
  nets complete over each cycle

net
  array of cells
  has <cellsPerNet>
  not discreet object
  nets are derived from a combination of information from multiple parts objects within the <netPopulation>
  <inputCellsPerNet> All nets in a population also have the same number of cells which receive external input
  <outputCellsPerNet> send external output

<cells>


<cell_structures>
  cell control properties
  stimulus moving through a net

<internalCoeff>
  how easily the cell is activated
  A value of 1.0 is neutral. Any higher value makes the cell more easily activated, and any lower value makes it more difficult to activate.


<broadcastCoeff>
  modifies the volume of any stimulus this cell sends any other cell as well as whether that stimulus is exitatory (positive value) or inhibitory (negative value)

<postLinks>
  list of all the other net cells to which this cell sends stimulus when activated

<postCell>
  index number (in net context) of the receiving cell

<linkCoeff>
  stimulus modifier specific only to this link and can be any value making it either exitatory (positive) or inhibitory (negative).
  The total stimulus that one cell receives from another then is primarily modified by the sending cell's <broadcastCoeff> multiplied by the <linkCoeff> corresponding to the <postLink> member in which <postCell> is the index (in net context) of the receiving cell.
  It's actually a bit more complicated than that but the complication has to do with information stored in <cell_structures> which I don't want to incorporate in the visualization yet.
